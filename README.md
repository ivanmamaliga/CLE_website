# Code Louisville Project.

The project was implemented using the mobile first approach. Used media queries to scale up the layout.

Based on fictitious enterprise, the website designed to implement the main requirements for the capstone project. The website is designed and build within the responsive, mobile first paradigm. It is build using flexbox, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website includes a responsive navigation menu, "hero" image/background, main area whith business projects and a energy savings calculator. The calculator should calculate the payoff time period based on investment, yearly project savings and the interest rate. 

For the mobile model it includes a humburger menu due to limited available area view, which expands to the full fledged menu when preseed. I included 3 media queries to create a mobile layout/user experience.

I also used the :nth-child and :hover pseudoclasses to decorate the list elements.

I used the JavaScript to calculate the projects payoff period and also to expand the hamburger menu.
